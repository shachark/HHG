Description: Heller-Heller-Gorfine (HHG) tests are a set of powerful statistical tests of multivariate goodness-of-fit, k-sample homogeneity, and independence. For the univariate case, the package also offers implementations of the DDP and ADP tests, which are consistent against all continuous alternatives but are distribution-free, and are thus much faster to apply.
